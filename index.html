                                        <p align="justify">Hi, my name is Edward Chu. This is my personal website, which I am currently using to help kick start my engineering career. Here you can find my resume, as well as a more thorough description of my skills, past engineering projects, and internships. It is my hope that this site will convey a much clearer picture of myself and my experiences than any piece of paper could, and do so in a visually stimulating manner. If you would like to do so, please feel free to reach out to me using the contact information on the sidebar.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">
                                        This website will be updated whenever necessary, and its purpose will likely evolve over time. For now however, its overarching purpose will be to reach out to people in industry.</p>

                                        <h3>Robstacle Course</h3>
                                        <p align="justify">ME72 is the capstone design project for Caltech mechanical engineering undergrads, and has rightfully earned an infamous reputation as a very high workload course. In my year, teams were tasked with the design, manufacture, operation, and everything in between of three robots. These robots worked in tandem to complete an obstacle course, and at the same time ferried a baton to a goal, akin to a relay race. On competition day, my team was one of only two able to complete the obstacle course in its entirety, out of five teams.</p>

                                        <h3>AAReST Cubesat</h3>
                                        <p align="justify">For my undergrad aerospace engineering minor, I participated in a spacecraft design course. Part of the course involved assisting with the work being done on Caltech's AAReST cubesat (Autonomous Assembly of a Reconfigurable Space Telescope), which is intended to demonstrate the concept of in-orbit assembly of large spacecraft. I was assigned to the telecom team, and worked to optimize AAReST's antenna design through simulation and network analyzer experimentation with an EM model of the cubesat that I built.</p>

                                        <h3>High Temperature Heat Exchanger</h3>
                                        <p align="justify">Heat exchangers are devices that transfer heat from one fluid to another, and are vitally important in power generation, HVAC, aircraft, industrial processes, and many other applications. I worked with a team to design a shell-and-tube heat exchanger to meet the performance requirements set by the U.S. DOE's ARPA-E. After determining the heat exchanger's design parameters in MATLAB and modeling it in SolidWorks, I used COMSOL to perform a finite element simulation of the system to analyze its structural and thermal performance.</p>

                                        <h3>Butterfly Wing Photonics</h3>
                                        <p align="justify">In nature, many of the brilliant colors you can find in birds, insects, and plants actually owe their brilliance more to light-interfering nanoscale structures found in their feathers or scales, rather than actual pigmentation. To study this phenomenon, I worked in a Caltech professor's laboratory to model the responsible structures found in the wings of several species of butterflies. We then attempted to mimic the photonic effects by recreating the structures using a 3D nanoprinter.</p>

                                        <h3>Mechanical Properties of Hiperco</h3>
                                        <p align="justify">Hiperco is an iron-cobalt alloy with exceptional magnetic properties, but its mechanical behavior leaves much to be desired and is still poorly understood. During my summer internship at Sandia National Laboratories, I worked with the Materials, Mechanics, and Tribology Department to study Hiperco's mechanical properties through a novel experimental technique. I worked with staff and technologists to prepare samples, set up experiments with a novel technique, and process and analyze data.</p>

                                        <h3>Lithium Ion Battery Reliability</h3>
                                        <p align="justify">Lithium-ion is perhaps the most visible battery technology to the modern consumer, used in devices ranging from smartphones to electric vehicles. Space satellites are no exception, but as space doesn't afford second chances, satellite batteries must perform to the highest standards of reliability. To help understand the effects of particulate contamination on battery reliability, I manufactured and tested dozens of Li-ion cells, and used various tools to discern causes of failure.</p>
