                                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                        <p align="justify">This was a team project course at Caltech, course number ME72.</p>
                                        <figure style="float:right;margin-left:20px">

                                        <p align="justify">At Caltech, each class of mechanical engineering undergrads is required to participate in ME72, Engineering Design Laboratory. The exact premise of the course changes every year, but the overall concept always remains the same. From the course catalog, ME72 is "A project-based course in which teams of students design, fabricate, analyze, test, and operate an electromechanical device to compete against devices designed by other student teams. The class lectures and the projects stress the integration of mechanical design, sensing, engineering analysis, and computation to solve problems in engineering system design." In the year before mine, for example, students built small, remote-controlled watercraft that competed against each other in games of robotic water polo. For my year, the objective was changed - this time, students would work together to design and build three robots that would navigate an obstacle course, and would also exchange a baton between themselves, akin to a relay race.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">By popular vote, the competition for my year was dubbed the "Robstacle Course". The competition's hurdles went as follows:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>The three robots are placed in their respective starting positions on the obstacle course. Robot 1 begins with the baton.</li>
                                            <li>The competition heat starts. Robot 1 must autonomously navigate a pylon field and transfer the baton to Robot 2. If it is unable to do so, it must wait until the autonomous period is over to enter tele-operated mode, and complete its tasks.</li>
                                            <li>Robot 2, with the baton, drives up, then down a seesaw/teeter-totter obstacle.</li>
                                            <li>Robot 2 then drives up a steep (30&deg;) ramp, onto an elevated platform, where it may pick up a 1 kg weight.</li>
                                            <li>Robot 2 transfers the baton to robot 3, which is at the bottom of the ramp descending from the elevated platform. Robot 2 is not required to go down this ramp.</li>
                                            <li>Robot 3, with the baton, pulls two pins to open a gate.</li>
                                            <li>Robot 3 drives through the open gate, up a shallow ramp, and deposits the baton in a receptacle to complete the race.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <figure>
                                            <img src="images/robstacle_course.jpg" alt="Concept art of the obstacle course." width=900px/><figcaption><i>Concept art of the obstacle course, with the starting line at the bottom left corner.

                                        <p align="justify">Each team was given a budget of $1300 to spend. Though this might seem like plenty at first glance, recall that all the robots were to be built from ground zero. Motors, gears, electronics, wheels, and raw materials all had to be purchased, or manufactured in-house. If something we purchased wasn't up to par, or some component broke, any repurchases also had to come out of this limited budget. Thus, all of the team's purchasing and budgeting was done very carefully and deliberately to make sure we did not run into any monetary issues down the line.</p>
                                        <hr/>
                                        <h3>Design Process</h3>
                                        <p align="justify">The first order of business, of course, was to brainstorm ideas. Early on, we decided to use a unique strategy: rather than transfer the batons from one robot to another, robots 2 and 3 would simply transport the entirety of robot 1, which held the baton, until the goal was reached, at which point robot 1 would deposit the baton into the goal. We thought this would make the transfer process more robust and reduce the risk of failure. However, this meant robot 1 would have to be small and lightweight, so it could be transported by the other two robots.</p>
                                        <figure style="float:right;margin-left:20px">
                                            <img src="images/transmission_assembly.png" alt="CAD of transmission." width=300px/><figcaption><i>CAD assembly of the 9:1 gear ratio transmission, which was used for all three of our robots' powered wheels.</i></figcaption>
                                        </figure>
                                        <p align="justify">There were three design philosophies we tried to incorporate as much as possible. They were designing for durability, designing for ease of modification and maintenance, and recycling designs as much as possible. Durability was important because of the limited time and budget. If our robots broke at all during assembly or testing, the money and time needed for repair and purchasing new components could be costly; in the worst case, the robots could even break on competition day. To this end, we decided to make the robots mostly out of aluminum, using other materials only occasionally. To improve ease of maintenance and modification, we emphasized modularity and the recycling of designs across the three robots. Components could be made separately, then attached with screws to the chassis for easy disassembly and adjustment. Designs were also copied between robots, especially between robots 2 and 3. For example, all three robots used the same transmission design for powered wheels, with the same wheels, gears, and motors. Furthermore, we tried to use as small a variety of screws as possible, greatly reducing the inconvenience of not only finding the right screws and screwdrivers but also tapping the threads themselves. These design decisions helped to reduce confusion and save time, which was perhaps the most constraining factor throughout the entire course.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">After a preliminary design review (PDR), in which the course instructors approved our early drafts, our team began to finalize our robot designs. We used SolidWorks to model the robots, and GrabCAD to coordinate design efforts between members. From the models, we produced engineering drawings to use for machining the various parts. Each robot consisted of three primary systems: the mobility system, the electronics system, and manipulator systems, which are each explained in detail below. Our design process of these systems culminated with the critical design review (CDR), after which we began fabrication in earnest.</p>
                                        <h4>Robot 1</h4>

                                            <figure style="float:right;margin-left:20px">

                                            <dd><p align="justify">The first robot starts with the baton before the race. The obstacles it had to contend with were a pylon field, essentially several rows of 8" diameter, 24" tall concrete-filled cylinders, and the transfer of the baton to the second robot. Furthermore, robot 1 was to operate autonomously, at least for a period of 40 seconds. After that, it was permitted for students to use remote control to assist robot 1 in completing its tasks.</p></dd>
                                            <dt>Mobility</dt><dd><p align="justify">To navigate in the pylon field, robot 1 had to be agile, but did not require much torque. Therefore, the mobility system for robot 1 only used two powered wheels, while the other two wheels were idlers. Omniwheels were used for the idlers so the robot could turn in place, an ability essential to navigating the pylons.</p></dd>

                                            <dd><p align="justify">All three robots' electronics systems were very similar, using Raspberry Pi Zeros as the microcontroller and connecting it to the breakout board, motor controllers, and other components. However, to accommodate the autonomous requirement, robot 1 had the addition of a webcam for the purpose of computer vision, which would allow robot 1 to determine its location in the pylon field. Furthermore, due to robot 1's small size and low weight requirement, we used only one electronics box to house both the circuits and batteries, made out of medium density fiberboard (MDF) instead of aluminum.</p></dd>
                                            <dt>Manipulator</dt><dd><p align="justify">Robot 1, besides for the mobility and electronics systems, required one more system for the baton. Our method was transporting the entirety of robot 1, so the system had to be able to reliably retain the baton for the entirety of the race, and also be able to deposit it in a receptacle at the race's end. Since the baton is a baseball, so we decided to use a ring mechanism to hold the ball, and simply flipped the ring with a servo to baton deposit.</p></dd>

After that, it must first contend with a seesaw, or teeter-totter, obstacle. The seesaw is 24" wide and 11.5' long, covered with skateboard deck tape to improve traction. The friction at the pivot point was also quite low, so the whole board would swing quite violently once a weight imbalance was incurred by the robot's movement. This is one reason why we emphasized robot durability in our design phase, since hard bouncing was unavoidable.</p>
                                            <p align="justify">The next obstacle for robot 2 was a 30&deg; inclined ramp leading to an elevated platform 4' above ground level, with dimensions 8'x8'. Again, the ramp was covered in skateboard grip tape to improve traction. On the elevated platform were a series of four 1-kg steel weights, which robot 2 could pick up for additional competition points. Then, robot 2 had to transfer the baton to robot 3 using another 30&deg; ramp, descending from the other side of the platform. Robot 2, however, was not actually required to traverse this ramp.</p></dd>

Not only did robot 2 have to traverse multiple inclines, but it also had to do so while transporting robot 1 - not an easy task in any measure. To provide sufficient torque, all four of robot 2's wheels were powered by their own motor and transmission system.</p>

However, the robot 2 instead had two electronics boxes, one for circuits and one for batteries, and both were made of aluminum.</p></dd>

To keep robot 1 in the robot 2's holding bay while traversing the difficult obstacles, we decided to use a powered ramp. The end of the ramp was connected to a continuous rotation servo with fishing line. To raise and lower the ramp, we could simply turn the servo a set amount, much like a drawbridge. To pick up the 1-kg weights, after much consideration of different methods like a scooper arm or a forklift-like mechanism, we went with using several rare earth permanent magnets. Simply driving up to the weights was enough to magnetically capture them.</p></dd>

Since robot 2 is not required to go down the descending ramp, our strategy was for robot 1 to exit robot 2's holding area, and drive down this ramp onto robot 3. Normally, two angled wooden guides sit in the middle of the descending ramp, to facilitate baton transfer for teams that wish to roll the baton from robot 2 to 3. Thankfully, these guides were removable beforehand, as our strategy was quite different from this.</p><p align="justify">Robot 3 then opens a gate by pulling two pins out of their sockets, and goes through the gate into an open area. During this stage, the competing teams' robots are allowed to make physical contact and attempts to interfere with the other team. This was yet another driver for our design philosophy of durability. After this open area, robot 3 is to drive up a shallow, &#60;10&deg; ramp to finally arrive at a flat platform. The platform has a hole in the middle, where the baton is deposited.</p></dd>

                                        <h3>Testing &amp; Improvements</h3>
                                        <p align="justify">After fabrication of each robot, we conducted initial testing on a flat wooden and concrete surfaces, much like the surfaces that were present in the obstacle course. The purpose of this test was simply to make sure the robot could move according to the input given to the remote control. There were several things we immediately noticed. First, although our robots were sufficiently maneuverable, they were jittery when accelerating, decelerating, and turning. This was fixed by rewriting and optimizing the controlling code. Second, the increased weight due to the majority aluminum build limited the robots' speed, but did give the desired result of sturdiness. Third, the robots could also carry a lot of weight and still move; this was a vital requirement that was demonstrably met with this test. And finally, it seemed that our transmission needed constant oiling to keep it running smoothly, which could be a major disadvantage if maintenance was needed in the middle of a race. To reduce this maintenance need, we wore down and work hardened our transmission gears by running them continuously for a long time, so they meshed together better. More gears could always be quickly and cheaply made with the waterjet machine if this process introduced any defects. Overall, the initial testing was a success, and we also identified several problems and fixed them.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">The next major test was the mobility demo, in which teams were given the opportunity to test their robots against the obstacles themselves. The biggest obstacle to test for was the 30&deg; ramp. We found that robot 2 was able to ascend the ramp, albeit with great effort and the need to build up speed beforehand. Tackling the many obstacles, however, caused various problems to manifest. The small gears of our transmissions fell off several times. Hardware and programming issues also caused problems when moving at low speeds, and prevented fine control of the motors. Low speeds also caused the friction in the gears to become greater than the motor torque, sometimes preventing movement at all. The weight distribution of the robots was suboptimal, and robot 2 was unable to ascend the ramp while carrying robot 1, which bounced around intensely in the holding area during ascension attempts. Wires loosened periodically. We also had many problems with the wheels, such as slippage, wheels not all being in contact with the ground/obstacle, and nonexistent shock absorption. Note that at this time, we were still using cheap plastic wheels for our robots, which had much less traction than the RC wheels that were still shipping to us.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">To fix these problems, we introduced additional hardware for the small gear, using pins to secure it to the motor shaft and also using Loctite super glue for extra robustness. All the wire connections were resoldered, and some new electronics hardware was ordered to improve the precision of motor control. Various aluminum parts were trimmed, and weights added, to achieve a more equal mass distribution. As for the wheel problems, most of them were solved when the RC wheels were finally shipped and replaced the interim plastic wheels. Finally, we came up with a new technique of moving robot 1 up robot 2 and 3's ramps backwards, which was not only easier for robot 1 to do with its rear-wheel drive but also resulted in better weight distribution.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">The next test was the functionality test, which was intended to verify the performance of the robots' manipulators. In our case, robot 2 was able to pick up the 1-kg weights, robot 1 was able to deposit the baton in the receptacle, and robot 3 was able to open the end gate. This test was very successful for us; the only problems we noticed were that the baton would sometimes bounce out of the holder on robot 1, and the fishing line connecting the servo to the ramp on robot 2 broke. To prevent this from happening in the future, we added bars on top of the ball holder, and chamfered the edges of the hole the fishing line was tied to to eliminate sharp edges the line broke on.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">The final test was a mock competition, where teams ran the entire course's obstacles to test everything together. Once again, various problems arose, and the team put in effort to fix each one. Hours before the mock competition, the Raspberry Pi Zero of robot 1 broke and wouldn't function at all. To test robot 2 and 3's ability to transport robot 1, we had to tape robot 1 in the respective holding areas. In addition, several gears and hubs failed and had to be remade. At this point though, they had already gone through quite a bit of testing, so we had learned their durability would be sufficient for competition day. During the trial, robot 2, carrying robot 1 on the seesaw, also flipped over due to the seesaw's sudden movement. Luckily, our robots did not suffer any damage. We learned to drive robot 2 more slowly at the fulcrum to prevent this in the future. Lastly, more software tweaking was done so that the Raspberry Pi Zeros would not have to be reset after every race, a time-consuming procedure that required a computer to be connected to the robot.</p>

                                        <h3>Competition Day &amp; Closing Thoughts</h3>
                                        <p align="justify">Finally, after nearly six months of work, competition day had arrived. There were five teams in total. The first part of the competition was a round robin, in which every team would compete against every other team at once, for a total of 10 matches. The second part was a single elimination bracket, where seeding was determined by the round robin results.</p>
                                        <p align="justify"> During the competition, our robots performed quite well. All robots were able to actuate their manipulators, and were able to move smoothly on the flat sections. None of our transmissions failed, and demonstrated excellent performance in climbing the ramp and seesaw obstacles. Although the spokes of one wheel on robot 1 broke in our first run, we were able to replace it with spares we had purchased. However, we elected not to use robot 1's autonomous function, and ran down the clock instead to use teleoperation after the autonomous period. This was because we felt the risk of the autonomy algorithm failing and causing robot 1 to lose the baton was too great - losing the baton meant that our match was automatically over. In the end, we were one of only two teams able to complete the course in its entirety by depositing the baton at the goal at least once.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">There were several things we could have improved upon, in hindsight. First, we overemphasized durability. Making our robots almost entirely out of aluminum did lend it the ability to survive harsh impacts, but the greatly increased weight made maneuverability difficult, and aluminum is rather expensive. Furthermore, the weight puts increased strain on purchased parts such as the RC wheels, which were perhaps not designed to carry so much weight and thus broke. Also, encoders to track wheel movement, and more powerful processors (Raspberry Pi Zeros are incredibly slow) would have significantly improved hardware performance. More testing could have been extremely useful for catching these design flaws and oversights. Looking back at our work, however, we considered the competition a success for us, as we scored reasonably well and were actually able to finish a race. And although the course has gained an infamous reputation for being an enormous time sink for mechanical engineering students, it remains an essential aspect of the Caltech mechanical engineering undergraduate experience.</p>
