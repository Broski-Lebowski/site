                                        <p align="justify">This internship occurred in the summer of 2013, at the Harry G. Steele Laboratory of Electrical Sciences at Caltech, Pasadena, California.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">Biomimetics, or biomimicry, is the practice of advancing technology by imitating designs found in nature. It has had a place in human innovation since prehistory, and its importance has only grown in modern times - countless inventions, from Velcro to high strength composites, have been inspired by and modeled after nature's solutions to engineering problems.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">The brilliant colors and iridescence found in many bird species, insects, and sea creatures are no exception. Scientists seeking to artificially mimic these colors find them particularly interesting due to their structural coloration, a phenomenon in which the colors that a material exhibits arise from special light-interfering structures, rather than purely from pigmentation. These structures are capable of interfering with photons in various ways due to their nanoscale size. Although any object with a size around the wavelength of visible light, 400-700 nm, can affect to some degree photons of that wavelength, the specific structures that produce structural coloration are often very elaborate and produce some of the most vivid colors in nature, some example photos of which can be seen below. Biomimicry of structural coloration has many potential applications, ranging from light-based transistors to antireflective glass.</p>

                                        <p align="justify">Many species of butterflies also exhibit structural coloration in their wings, using diverse nanostructures including diffraction gratings, selective mirrors, and photonic crystals. Perhaps the most famous example is butterflies of the <i>Morpho</i> genus, which derive their bright iridescent coloration from 3D Christmas tree-like structures in their scales.</p>

                                        <p align="justify">These butterfly photonic nanostructures were the subject of my internship. The objective was to study these nanostructures, and then try to replicate them from scratch by creating an artificial sample. The intention was to fabricate the sample using a 3D nanoprinter, specifically the Nanoscribe Photonic Professional GT, a laser lithography system that uses two photon polymerization to produce features with a resolution of around 300 nanometers.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">I had no exposure to photonics prior to the internship, so the first order of business was simply to gain at least a cursory understanding of the field. The scientific literature on the subject, found through Google Scholar, proved invaluable for this purpose. Furthermore, papers related to butterfly wing photonics biomimicry were especially useful for obtaining numerical data about the butterfly wing structures, since we did not have any specimens to study directly. At the time, past attempts to reproduce butterfly wing photonic effects seemed to mostly consist of layer deposition or molding techniques using natural scales from dead specimens. Our approach of direct fabrication using a 3D nanoprinter was the first such application of the technology to our knowledge.</p>

                                        </figure>
                                        <p align="justify">As mentioned previously, there are a plethora of different photonic nanostructures that can be found across the many species of butterflies. For ease of fabrication, we chose to replicate the design of the dorsal scales of the species <i>Cyanophrys remus</i>, the dimensional parameters of which are documented by Kert√©sz et al. in <i>Gleaming and dull surface textures from photonic-crystal-type nanostructures in the butterfly</i> Cyanophrys remus. The nanostructure consists of two distinct layers. The upper layer is made up of large, hollow ridges connected by thin crossribs, forming a grid-like pattern. The lower layer consists of a "pepper-pot" structure with foam-like appearance, the holes of which are distributed on the nodes of a triangular lattice. This layer completely fills the hollow volume of the ridges and is visible through the windows of the grid layer. Due to constraints imposed by the 3D nanoprinter, however, we chose to replicate only the top layer of ridges and crossribs in our sample. Even with only one layer, photonic effects should nonetheless still be observable.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">The Photonic Professional GT prints using multiphoton lithography, causing light-sensitive material (photoresist) to polymerize at precise locations with a laser. This creates ellipsoids about 250 nanometers wide and 1 micron tall, which can overlap to create more complex shapes. To print our sample, I first used MatLab to model the wing nanostructure. The ridges and crossribs were modeled as vectors, with each vector denoting a continuous line of polymerization. Multiple vectors were needed to model each ridge due to their greater thickness. Next, to gain a clearer picture of what the final print would look like, I used SolidWorks to reconstruct the MatLab model, with each vector more realistically represented as a three dimensional object. With this better visualization from SolidWorks, it was much easier to find and correct any mistakes that were in the MatLab script.</p>

                                            With the visual aid provided by the SolidWorks model, the MatLab model was adjusted and then its parameters exported to Describe, the proprietary software for interfacing with the Photonic Professional GT. Like MatLab, Describe uses vectors to describe the laser path. With the necessary print parameters such as laser power and positioning defined, printing of the nanostructure could finally begin, using a glass slide as the substrate. Printing one entire sample usually took about a day to complete. After printing, the sample was developed by treating it with a hydrogen fluoride solution, to dissolve and wash away the unpolymerized photoresist.

                                            Our very first print was a success - although it was normally clear in color, under a sufficiently bright light, the sample was iridescent, meaning the material would reflect different colors depending on the viewing angle or illumination angle. In our case, the photonic crystals in our sample caused it to brightly reflect the colors of the visible spectrum, much like a CD. Following this success, we wanted to observe the nanostructure in a microscope to compare its shape to the SolidWorks model. Since the nanostructure cannot be resolved by visible light, we had to use scanning electron microscopes. To prepare it for SEM, which requires its samples to be conductive, we first coated the print in a layer of alumina, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, or titanium, several nanometers thick using atomic layer deposition. It was then imaged in both SEM and environmental SEM, both of which showed that its shape was fairly close to what we intended. eSEM is more convenient since it does not require a vacuum; however, its resolution is much worse than SEM's. As a side note, a gold sputter process would have created an even more conductive and thinner surface on the samples, but the sputtering machine was out of service at the time.

One major experiment we also did was to vary laser power. A higher laser power produces a thicker line of polymer, which increases the sample's durability, but decreases the resolution, and also risks disintegrating the polymer from high heat. In constrast, a lower laser power increases the resolution and thus the detail that can be reproduced in the sample. However, the polymer may not adhere to the substrate if the laser power is too low, resulting in a worthless print. To find the range of laser powers that would produce good samples, I wrote a Describe script that varied laser power over 25 sections in a large area, then used the eSEM to locate the sections that failed.</p>

                                        <p align="justify">With the lower limit of laser power found, all of our subsequent nanostructure prints used this limit to give as much resolution to the print as possible. These newer samples, like our first sample, reflected brightly at specific angles. However, they seemed to lose their iridescence. Specifically, they no longer reflected various colors; instead, they now tended to reflect only one color, usually a reddish-orange hue. This was a rather unexpected result from simply changing the laser power, especially since all of the samples with this higher resolution displayed this behavior. Varying the dimensional parameters, such as the size of the windows, did not restore iridescence; this only sometimes changed the specific color that was reflected. Although the exact reason for this is unclear, this result demonstrates that not only can iridescence arise from photonic crystals, so too can specific colors, and these structures can be produced artificially with a 3D nanoprinter.</p>
                                        <p align="justify">The final task with the time we had left was to obtain numerical data, specifically on the reflectance properties of our samples, and then compare it to the reflectance of the natural butterfly wings we attempted to copy. The spectral reflectance curve, shown in the figure to the left, describes the proportion of electromagnetic power that is reflected by the material versus the wavelength of the light radiation. The instrument we used is called a spectrophotometer, paired with a so-called integrating sphere which eliminates the measurement's dependence on viewing angle. This is in contrast to specular reflection, which is simply the reflectance at a viewing angle normal to the surface. The measurement attempt, however, was not successful: the spot size of the integrating sphere was 25 square millimeters, while our largest samples were less than 2 millimeters square in area. Spectrophotometers with a smaller spot size did exist on campus, but were not open to use without extensive training. After all, the group I was working with did not specialize in photonics.</p>
